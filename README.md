# Ruby Convention
- variables are defined with lowercase with underscores:
> first_name = "Kevin"

# Objects

- Ruby is an object-oriented programming language
- No "primitives"
- Almost everything is "object"
- Objects can represent abstract class
- have attributes
- instance of class
- have behaviours

# Variables

- variables **are not** objects
- it stores a reference of an object
- once a variable is assigned an object, it works like an object

## Variable Scope Indicators

| Scope           | Indicator                                           |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Global | $variable         |
| Class       | @@variable                 |
| Instance         | @variable             |
| Local         | variable             |
| Block         | variable             |

- note that class and instances are also variables, not objects !
